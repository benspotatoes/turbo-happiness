# Ben's Potatoes
A compilation of miscellaneous resources (development or otherwise) commonly
used by projects from Ben's Potatoes.
Originally meant to be *Resources*, but GitHub recommended *turbo-happiness*,
and that sounded much more awesome (and that inspired me to create
[namegen](http://rubygems.org/gems/namegen)!).
